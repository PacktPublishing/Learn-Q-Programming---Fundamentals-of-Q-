# Integer Factorization Sample #

This sample contains Q# code implementing Shor's quantum algorithm for
factoring integers. The sample relies on the arithmetic library provided as
a part of Microsoft.Quantum.Canon library.

## Manifest ##

- [Shor.qs](./Shor.qs): Q# implementation of Shor's algorithm.
- [Program.cs](./Program.cs): C# console application running Shor's algorithm
  on Quantum simulator
- [IntegerFactorization.csproj](./IntegerFactorization.csproj): Main C# project for the sample.
